# ClickUp API Client - OAuth 2.0 Conceptual Support

This document outlines the conceptual approach for supporting OAuth 2.0 authentication with the ClickUp API using this .NET client library.

## Library's Role in OAuth 2.0

The ClickUp.Api.Client.Net library **will not directly handle user-interactive portions of the OAuth 2.0 flow**. This means:

*   It will not host a web server or redirect users to the ClickUp authorization page.
*   It will not listen for the callback from ClickUp containing the authorization code.

These responsibilities lie with the consuming application (e.g., an ASP.NET Core web application, a desktop application with an embedded browser, or a mobile application).

## Library Provided Helpers

The library **will provide helper functionalities** to assist the consuming application in managing the OAuth 2.0 flow:

1.  **Generating the Authorization URL:**
    *   A utility method will be available to construct the correct ClickUp Authorization URL.
    *   Inputs: `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, and optionally `state`.
    *   Output: The fully formed URL that the consuming application can use to redirect the user.
    *   Example: `string GetAuthorizationUrl(string clientId, string redirectUri, string? state = null);`

2.  **Exchanging Authorization Code for Tokens:**
    *   A method within an OAuth-specific service (e.g., `OAuthService` or directly on `IAuthorizationService`) will handle exchanging the authorization code (obtained by the consuming application after user grants permission and is redirected back) for an access token and a refresh token.
    *   Inputs: `client_id`, `client_secret`, `authorization_code`, `redirect_uri`.
    *   Output: A DTO containing the `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_in`, and any other relevant token information provided by ClickUp.
    *   Example: `Task<OAuthTokenResponse> ExchangeCodeForTokenAsync(string clientId, string clientSecret, string code, string redirectUri);`

## Client Initialization with OAuth Tokens

Once the consuming application has obtained an access token (and optionally a refresh token):

*   The library will allow initialization of the main ClickUp client (or relevant services) directly with these tokens.
*   This might involve configuring `ClickUpClientOptions` with the access token and potentially the refresh token and expiry information.

## Automatic Token Usage and Refresh

*   When configured with an access token (and refresh mechanism), the library will automatically include the access token in the `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header for API requests.
*   This would likely be managed by a dedicated `DelegatingHandler` (e.g., `OAuthDelegatingHandler`), different from the `AuthenticationDelegatingHandler` used for Personal Access Tokens.
*   **Token Refresh:**
    *   If a refresh token is provided, this handler (or a related component) will be responsible for:
        *   Detecting expired access tokens (e.g., via a 401 response with a specific error code from ClickUp indicating an expired token).
        *   Automatically using the refresh token to request a new access token from ClickUp's token endpoint.
        *   Updating the stored access token (and potentially new refresh token/expiry) for subsequent requests.
        *   Retrying the original failed request with the new access token.
    *   The library might expose an event or callback mechanism for the consuming application to be notified when tokens are refreshed, allowing the application to update its secure token store.

## Secure Token Storage

*   **Crucially, the secure storage and management of obtained access tokens and refresh tokens are the responsibility of the consuming application.**
*   The library will operate with the tokens it's given during its lifetime or that it refreshes but will not persist them beyond its in-memory state.

## Future Implementation Considerations

*   A new `OAuthDelegatingHandler` would be added to the HTTP client pipeline.
*   The `ClickUpClientOptions` would be extended to include `OAuthClientId`, `OAuthClientSecret`, and potentially fields to store/manage the access and refresh tokens if the client is to handle refresh internally.
*   The `IAuthorizationService` might be extended with methods like `RefreshAccessTokenAsync(string clientId, string clientSecret, string refreshToken)`.

This approach ensures that the library provides the necessary tools for OAuth 2.0 integration while leaving the user interaction and secure token storage to the client application, which is standard practice for API client libraries.
