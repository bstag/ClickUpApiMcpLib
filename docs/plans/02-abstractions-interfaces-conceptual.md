# Phase 1, Step 2: Define Abstractions/Interfaces (Conceptual)

This document outlines the conceptual approach for defining C# interfaces for the API client services. These interfaces will form the contract for interacting with the ClickUp API, promoting testability and a clean separation of concerns. This will reside in the Abstractions project.

## General Philosophy

Interfaces will define the available operations that can be performed against the ClickUp API. Each interface will typically group related API endpoints. The implementation of these interfaces will reside in the `Client` project.

## Naming Conventions

- **Interface Names:**
    - Will be prefixed with `I` (e.g., `ITaskService`, `ICommentService`).
    - The core name will be derived from the primary resource or functional grouping they represent, often aligning with OpenAPI tags (e.g., "Tasks", "Comments").
    - Suffix `Service` will be used to clearly indicate its purpose (e.g., `ITaskService`).
- **Method Names:**
    - Will be PascalCase (e.g., `GetTaskAsync`, `CreateCommentAsync`).
    - Should clearly describe the action being performed and the resource it acts upon.
    - Will generally align with the OpenAPI `operationId` if it's descriptive and idiomatic for C#. If not, a more suitable C# idiomatic name will be chosen.
    - Asynchronous methods will be suffixed with `Async`.

## Grouping of Operations

- **Primary Grouping: OpenAPI Tags:** API operations will primarily be grouped into interfaces based on their `tags` in the OpenAPI specification.
    - For example, all operations tagged "Tasks" (e.g., `GET /task/{task_id}`, `POST /list/{list_id}/task`) would likely go into an `ITaskService` interface.
- **Logical Grouping:** If an OpenAPI tag encompasses too many operations or operations that could be logically subdivided for clarity, further breakdown might occur. However, the starting point will be tags.
- **Singleton Operations:** Operations not clearly fitting under a resource tag might be grouped into a more general interface like `IMiscellaneousService` or `IClickUpClient` (for very generic, top-level operations), but this should be minimized.

## Method Signatures

- **Parameters:**
    - Method parameters will correspond to the path, query, header, and request body parameters defined in the OpenAPI specification.
    - C# models (records) defined in "Phase 2, Step 5" will be used for request bodies.
    - Simple types (e.g., `string`, `int`, `Guid`) will be used for path and query parameters.
    - Required parameters in OpenAPI will be non-nullable parameters in the C# method.
    - Optional parameters will be nullable or have default values.
    - An optional `CancellationToken` parameter will be included in all asynchronous methods to support cancellation.
- **Return Types:**
    - All API-calling methods will be asynchronous and return `System.Threading.Tasks.Task<T>`.
    - `T` will be the C# model (record) representing the response body (e.g., `Task<TaskModel>`, `Task<List<CommentModel>>`).
    - For operations that do not return a body (e.g., HTTP 204 No Content), `Task` (non-generic) will be returned.
    - For operations that return simple types (e.g. a count or a boolean status directly in the response, not wrapped in a JSON object), `Task<SimpleType>` (e.g. `Task<int>`, `Task<bool>`) will be used.
    - Responses that could be errors will be handled by a global exception system (detailed in a separate step), so methods will typically return the success payload directly or throw an exception on failure. We might consider a `Result<T, E>` type pattern later if exceptions are not sufficient.

## Common Parameters

- Parameters that are common across many API calls (e.g., authentication tokens, API version headers) will not necessarily be part of every method signature.
- These will likely be handled by the HTTP client pipeline (e.g., through `HttpClient` default headers or message handlers) configured when the service client is instantiated. This keeps the interface methods cleaner.

## Extensibility

- Interfaces will be designed to allow for future additions without breaking existing implementations where possible (e.g., by adding new methods).
- If the API introduces versioning that significantly changes method signatures or response types for the same conceptual operation, new interface methods or even new interface versions (e.g., `ITaskServiceV2`) might be considered.

## Example (Conceptual)

Assuming an OpenAPI specification with operations tagged "Teams":

```csharp
// In Abstractions project (e.g., ClickUp.Net.Abstractions.dll)
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using ClickUp.Net.Models; // Assuming models are in this namespace

namespace ClickUp.Net.Abstractions
{
    public interface ITeamService
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets all teams accessible by the authenticated user.
        /// </summary>
        Task<List<Team>> GetTeamsAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets details for a specific team.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="teamId">The ID of the team to retrieve.</param>
        /// <param name="cancellationToken">Cancellation token.</param>
        Task<Team> GetTeamAsync(string teamId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);

        /// <summary>
        /// Creates a new team.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="createTeamRequest">The details of the team to create.</param>
        /// <param name="cancellationToken">Cancellation token.</param>
        Task<Team> CreateTeamAsync(CreateTeamRequest createTeamRequest, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);

        // ... other team-related operations (UpdateTeamAsync, DeleteTeamAsync, etc.)
    }
}
```

## Documentation

- Each interface and method will be documented with XML documentation comments (`<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`), explaining its purpose, parameters, and what it returns. This documentation can be generated from the OpenAPI summary/description fields.

## Next Steps

- Obtain the actual `ClickUp-6-17-25.json` file.
- Analyze the tags and operationIds within the OpenAPI specification to plan the specific interfaces and methods.
- Start drafting the actual C# interface files based on this conceptual approach and the API specification.
