# Updated SDK Implementation Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing the ClickUp API SDK. It serves as a central hub, linking to detailed plans for each major component of the SDK.

The goal is to create a robust, well-documented, and easy-to-use .NET SDK that provides full access to the ClickUp API's capabilities, including resilience, advanced data handling, and AI integration features.

## Overall Architecture

The SDK will be composed of the following key parts:

1.  **Core Models & Abstractions:** Defines the data structures (DTOs) and service interfaces.
2.  **Service Implementations:** Concrete implementations of the service interfaces, handling the actual API communication.
3.  **HTTP Client & Helpers:** Manages HTTP requests, authentication, and serialization.
4.  **Exception Handling:** Provides a clear and consistent way to manage API errors.
5.  **Resilience:** Implements fault tolerance mechanisms like retries and circuit breakers.
6.  **Data Handling Helpers:** Includes utilities for common tasks like pagination.
7.  **Testing:** Encompasses unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.
8.  **API Documentation:** Generates comprehensive documentation for SDK consumers.
9.  **Example Projects:** Showcases SDK usage in practical scenarios.
10. **Webhook Helpers:** Provides support for consuming ClickUp webhooks.
11. **AI Integration:** Enables interaction with the SDK through AI agents using Semantic Kernel.

## Detailed Plans

Below are links to the detailed planning documents for each component:

*   **[1. Core Models and Abstractions](./core/01-CoreModelsAndAbstractions.md)**
    *   Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for API requests and responses.
    *   Service interface definitions.
*   **[2. Service Implementations](./services/02-ServiceImplementations.md)**
    *   Implementation details for each service (Tasks, Lists, etc.).
    *   HTTP call logic and response processing.
*   **[3. HTTP Client and Helpers](./http/03-HttpClientAndHelpers.md)**
    *   `IHttpClientFactory` setup and configuration.
    *   Authentication handling (Personal API Token).
    *   JSON serialization settings.
    *   Query string construction.
*   **[4. Exception Handling System](./exceptions/04-ExceptionHandling.md)**
    *   Custom exception hierarchy.
    *   Centralized error handling logic.
*   **[5. Resilience with Polly](./resilience/05-ResilienceWithPolly.md)**
    *   Retry policies.
    *   Circuit breaker policies.
*   **[6. Pagination Helpers](./helpers/06-PaginationHelpers.md)**
    *   Strategies for handling paginated API responses.
    *   `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` implementation for easy consumption.
*   **[7. Testing Strategy](./testing/07-TestingStrategy.md)**
    *   Unit testing approach and scope.
    *   Integration testing approach and scope.
*   **[8. API Documentation (DocFX)](./documentation/08-ApiDocumentation.md)**
    *   DocFX setup and configuration.
    *   XML documentation standards.
    *   Conceptual documentation topics.
*   **[9. Showcase Example Projects](./examples/09-ExampleProjects.md)**
    *   Plans for console and worker service examples.
    *   Demonstration of key SDK features.
*   **[10. Webhook Helpers](./webhooks/10-WebhookHelpers.md)**
    *   Utilities for webhook signature validation and payload processing.
*   **[11. AI Integration (Semantic Kernel)](./ai_integration/11-SemanticKernelIntegration.md)**
    *   Semantic Kernel plugin design.
    *   Integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP).

This structured approach aims to ensure all aspects of the `NEW_OVERALL_PLAN.md` are thoroughly addressed, leading to a high-quality SDK.
