# Services

This document provides an overview of the service implementations in the ClickUp API Client SDK.

## Service Implementation Status

All service interfaces defined in the `ClickUp.Api.Client.Abstractions` project have a corresponding implementation in the `ClickUp.Api.Client` project. Based on a review of the source code, all service methods have been implemented and do not throw `NotImplementedException`.

### Completed Services

The following services are considered implemented:

- `AttachmentsService`
- `AuthorizationService`
- `ChatService`
- `CommentService`
- `CustomFieldsService`
- `DocsService`
- `FoldersService`
- `GoalsService`
- `GuestsService`
- `ListsService`
- `MembersService`
- `RolesService`
- `SharedHierarchyService`
- `SpacesService`
- `TagsService`
- `TaskChecklistsService`
- `TaskRelationshipsService`
- `TasksService`
- `TemplatesService`
- `TimeTrackingService`
- `UserGroupService`
- `UsersService`
- `ViewsService`
- `WebhooksService`
- `WorkspacesService`

### To-Do

While all services are implemented, the following tasks remain:

- **Increase Unit Test Coverage**: Although implementations exist, the unit test coverage for many of the services can be improved to ensure all edge cases and error conditions are handled correctly.
- **Expand Integration Tests**: More integration tests are needed to verify the behavior of the services against the live ClickUp API.
