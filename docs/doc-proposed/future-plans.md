# Future Plans

This document outlines the future work planned for the ClickUp API Client SDK. It has been updated to reflect the completion of the initial service implementations and a review of the authentication system, test coverage, resilience policies, and documentation.

## Authentication Enhancements

- **OAuth 2.0 Token Refresh**: Implement logic to automatically refresh expired OAuth 2.0 access tokens.
- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow Helpers**: Provide helper methods to simplify the initial OAuth 2.0 authorization process.

## Developer Experience Enhancements

- **API Documentation with DocFX**: While the DocFX project is well-structured, the following work is needed to make it a complete and valuable resource for developers:
    - **Complete Conceptual Articles**: Fill in the placeholder content for the `webhooks.md` and `semantic-kernel-integration.md` articles.
    - **Generate and Publish API Reference**: Ensure that the XML comments in the source code are complete and accurate, and then build and publish the API reference documentation to a live URL.
    - **Add Visuals**: Enhance the documentation with diagrams, screenshots, and other visuals to improve clarity.
    - **Implement Versioning**: Establish a strategy for versioning the documentation to correspond with different versions of the SDK.


## Advanced Features

- **Webhook Helpers**: Provide utilities for consuming ClickUp webhooks.

- **Semantic Kernel Integration**: Create Semantic Kernel plugins to make the SDK easily consumable by AI agents.
