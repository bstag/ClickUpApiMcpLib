Review /docs/OpenApiSpec/ClickUp-6-17-25.json. This file is a OpenApi JSON document it details out the ClickUp Api including all the calls and objects that are used. The website reference is also here https://developer.clickup.com/reference/. Please review all the documentation and break down how we would implement this Api which includes interfaces, models, services, helpers, global exception system in the current .net 9 projects structure which includes a client, models, abstraction and test  project. The solution also includes what will be come two example projects in the /examples folder that are a .net core console and worker.  Put all the things you learn in the /docs/plans folder. Break down the phases and steps you believe we need to do to accomplish this. Save all prompts you get from me with the date and time in /docs/prompts.md.
