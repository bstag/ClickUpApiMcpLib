Review /docs/OpenApiSpec/ClickUp-6-17-25.json. This file is a OpenApi JSON document it details out the ClickUp Api including all the calls and objects that are used. The website reference is also here https://developer.clickup.com/reference/. Please review all the documentation and break down how we would implement this Api which includes interfaces, models, services, helpers, global exception system in the current .net 9 projects structure which includes a client, models, abstraction and test  project. The solution also includes what will be come two example projects in the /examples folder that are a .net core console and worker.  Put all the things you learn in the /docs/plans folder. Break down the phases and steps you believe we need to do to accomplish this. Save all prompts you get from me with the date and time in /docs/prompts.md.

This is a .net 9 core project. You have a file called agents.md in the root folder that has knowledge you found matters. Pease follow the rules and information in it. It contains plenty of information on this repository. Let me know if I should give you more based on tasks at hand.

In the plans created in /docs/plans/updatedPlans/ConsolidatedPlans.md please do the next two logical steps.
