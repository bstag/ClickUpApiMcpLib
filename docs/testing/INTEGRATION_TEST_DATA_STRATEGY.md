# Integration Test Data Setup and Teardown Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for managing test data for integration tests against the ClickUp API. Reliable and consistent test data is crucial for ensuring the stability and correctness of the SDK's integration with the live ClickUp environment.

## Guiding Principles

1.  **Isolation:** Tests should be isolated and not depend on the state left by other tests.
2.  **Repeatability:** Tests should produce the same results when run multiple times with the same initial conditions.
3.  **Cleanliness:** The ClickUp workspace used for testing should be kept as clean as possible, with test-generated data removed after tests.
4.  **Realism:** Test data should reflect realistic usage scenarios where possible.
5.  **Security:** API keys and other sensitive information must be handled securely.
6.  **Efficiency:** Setup and teardown processes should be reasonably fast to avoid long test execution times.

## Core Strategies

### 1. Dedicated Test Workspace/Account

*   **Strategy:** Utilize a dedicated ClickUp Workspace specifically for running integration tests. This workspace should not be used for any production or critical development work.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Maximizes isolation from real user data.
    *   Simplifies cleanup as the entire workspace's contents can be considered ephemeral or test-related.
    *   Reduces risk of accidental interference with important data.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires setting up and maintaining a separate ClickUp account/workspace.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Obtain a new ClickUp account or use an existing non-critical one.
    *   Create a dedicated Workspace within this account for testing.

### 2. Test Data Lifecycle Management

*   **Strategy:** Each integration test (or test class) should be responsible for creating the specific data it needs and ensuring that data is cleaned up afterwards, even if the test fails.
*   **Methods:**
    *   **Programmatic Setup/Teardown:** Use the SDK itself to create entities (Spaces, Folders, Lists, Tasks, Comments, etc.) before a test run and delete them after.
        *   **Setup:** Implemented in test fixture setup methods (e.g., `IAsyncLifetime.InitializeAsync`, `[CollectionFixture]` setup, or `[ClassInitialize]` methods).
        *   **Teardown:** Implemented in test fixture disposal methods (e.g., `IAsyncLifetime.DisposeAsync`, `IDisposable.Dispose`, or `[ClassCleanup]` methods). Utilize `try...finally` blocks to ensure cleanup happens.
    *   **Unique Naming Conventions:** Use unique prefixes or suffixes (e.g., `test_entity_<timestamp>_<guid>`) for created entities. This can help in:
        *   Identifying test-generated data.
        *   Bulk cleanup scripts if manual intervention is ever needed.
    *   **Hierarchical Cleanup:** When deleting parent entities (like a Space), ensure the API or SDK handles deletion of child entities (Folders, Lists, Tasks within that Space). If not, cleanup must be done from child to parent. ClickUp API generally handles cascading deletes for Spaces, Folders, and Lists.

### 3. API Key and Configuration Management

*   **Strategy:** Securely manage API keys and other configuration details (like Workspace ID, Space ID for testing).
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Store API keys and sensitive configuration (e.g., `CLICKUP_TEST_API_TOKEN`, `CLICKUP_TEST_WORKSPACE_ID`) as environment variables on the CI server and local development machines. This is a common and secure practice.
    *   **User Secrets (for local development):** .NET's User Secrets manager can be used for local development to keep API keys out of source control.
    *   **Configuration Files (for non-sensitive data):** Non-sensitive configuration like default list names or test parameters can be in `appsettings.testing.json` (gitignored if it ever contains template sensitive data, or use a template approach).
    *   **Test Base Class/Fixture:** A base class or collection fixture for integration tests should be responsible for loading this configuration.

### 4. Handling Rate Limiting

*   **Strategy:** Be mindful of ClickUp API rate limits during test setup, execution, and teardown, as these phases can involve numerous API calls.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Efficient API Usage:** Create only necessary data. Avoid excessive polling or redundant calls.
    *   **Polly Policies:** The SDK's built-in Polly policies for rate limiting (retry-after, exponential backoff) should help mitigate issues during test execution. Ensure these are active and configured appropriately for the test environment if necessary.
    *   **Staggered Setup/Teardown:** If creating/deleting a very large number of entities, introduce small delays between operations if rate limiting becomes an issue, though this should be a last resort.
    *   **Monitor `Retry-After` Headers:** The SDK (and thus tests using it) should respect `Retry-After` headers.

### 5. Stable vs. Dynamic Data

*   **Strategy:** Differentiate between data that can be relatively stable and data that must be dynamic for each test run.
    *   **Stable Base Data:** A pre-existing Test Space or even a Test Folder/List could be manually created and its ID configured for tests that don't modify it heavily or can clean up within it. This can save setup time.
        *   *Caution:* If tests modify this stable data, they MUST reliably revert it to its original state.
    *   **Dynamic Data:** For most CRUD operations, entities should be created and deleted per test or per test class to ensure isolation. For example, a test for "creating a task" should create a new list (or use a freshly created one for the test class) and then delete it.

### 6. Test Categories / Conditional Execution

*   **Strategy:** Separate integration tests from unit tests so they can be run on demand, especially in CI environments where they might be slower or require specific configurations.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **xUnit Test Traits:** Use `[Trait("Category", "Integration")]` to mark integration tests.
    *   **Separate Test Project (Optional):** Could have a `ClickUp.Api.Client.IntegrationTests.csproj` if separation needs to be stricter.
    *   **CI Configuration:** Configure the CI pipeline to run integration tests based on specific triggers (e.g., nightly, on release branches, or manually triggered) using the test category filter.

## Example Workflow for a Test Class (e.g., `TaskServiceIntegrationTests`)

1.  **Fixture Setup (`IAsyncLifetime.InitializeAsync` or similar):**
    *   Load API token and Workspace ID from configuration (environment variables/user secrets).
    *   Create a unique Test Space (e.g., `sdk_tests_tasks_<timestamp>`). Store its ID.
    *   Create a unique Test Folder within that Space. Store its ID.
    *   Create a unique Test List within that Folder. Store its ID. This List will be the primary target for task creation tests in this class.

2.  **Test Method (e.g., `CreateTask_ValidData_ReturnsTask`):**
    *   Use the pre-created List ID from the fixture.
    *   Call the SDK method to create a task.
    *   Perform assertions.
    *   *Cleanup (optional here if fixture handles it):* If this task needs to be deleted immediately for subsequent tests in the same class to have a clean slate *before* the fixture disposes of the list, delete it here. Otherwise, rely on fixture disposal.

3.  **Fixture Teardown (`IAsyncLifetime.DisposeAsync` or similar):**
    *   Delete the Test Space created in setup (this should cascade and delete the Folder, List, and any tasks within it).
    *   Use `try...catch` to log any errors during cleanup but ensure all cleanup steps are attempted.

## Future Considerations

*   **Test Data Builders/Factories:** For complex objects, implement builder patterns to create test data DTOs easily.
*   **Snapshot Testing:** For complex response objects, consider snapshot testing approaches to verify API responses, though this requires careful management of snapshot files.
*   **Mocking API for Specific Error Scenarios:** While the goal is to test against the live API, for very specific, hard-to-trigger API error states, consider if a configurable mock server or a special test API endpoint (if ClickUp provided one) would be beneficial for isolated cases. This is generally out of scope for standard integration tests.

This strategy will be refined as integration tests are developed and more is learned about the practicalities of interacting with the ClickUp API in a test context.
