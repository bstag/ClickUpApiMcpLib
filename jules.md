# Jules' Knowledge Base

This file contains specific notes, conventions, and information Jules needs to remember about this repository and the ongoing tasks.

## Project Goals:
- Develop a .NET client library for the ClickUp API.
- Initially focus on creating C# models based on the OpenAPI specification.

## Key Files:
- OpenAPI Spec: `/docs/OpenApiSpec/ClickUp-6-17-25.json`
- Conceptual Model Plan: `docs/plans/01-core-models-conceptual.md`
- Actual Model Implementation Plan: `docs/plans/01-core-models-actual.md`
- Prompts: `docs/prompts.md`
- Model Source Code: `src/ClickUp.Api.Client.Models/`

## Project Description:
This project aims to build a C#/.NET client library for the ClickUp API. The library will provide models and services to interact with the ClickUp API, based on the OpenAPI specification found in `/docs/OpenApiSpec/ClickUp-6-17-25.json`.

## Current Task:
Review existing API models, update the progress tracking document (`docs/plans/01-core-models-actual.md`), continue implementing new models according to the plan, and organize them into appropriate folders. Also, maintain `docs/prompts.md` for user prompts and `jules.md` for project context and important notes.
