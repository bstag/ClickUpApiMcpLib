# Jules' Knowledge Base

This file contains specific notes, conventions, and information Jules needs to remember about this repository and the ongoing tasks.

## Project Overview & Goals
- Objective: Develop a .NET client library for the ClickUp API.
- Current Phase: Model creation based on OpenAPI specification (`docs/OpenApiSpec/ClickUp-6-17-25.json`).
- Conceptual Plan: `docs/plans/01-core-models-conceptual.md` (guides naming, C# type mapping, etc.).
- Implementation Tracking: `docs/plans/01-core-models-actual.md` (tracks specific schemas and their completion status).

## Development Process

1.  **Model Creation**: Implement C# models based on the OpenAPI specification.
    *   Group models into folders based on their purpose and the base endpoint type they are for.
2.  **Service Implementation**: Create services to interact with the API endpoints.
3.  **Interface Definitions**: Define abstractions for models and services.
4.  **Helper Utilities**: Develop any necessary helper functions.
5.  **Exception Handling**: Implement a global exception handling system.
6.  **Testing**: Write unit tests for the client library.
7.  **Example Projects**: Create example console and worker projects to demonstrate usage.

## Key Decisions & Progress
- (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (Placeholder)): Successfully implemented P0, P1, and numerous P2 models from `01-core-models-actual.md`. This includes core entities, request/response wrappers, and helper DTOs/enums for features like Tasks, Folders, Spaces, Goals, Custom Fields, Time Tracking, Webhooks, v3 Docs, and v3 Chat.
- Folder Structure: Models are organized under `src/ClickUp.Api.Client.Models/` into `Common/`, `Entities/`, `RequestModels/`, and `ResponseModels/`, further categorized by feature (e.g., `Entities/Tasks`, `RequestModels/Goals`).
- Logging: User prompts are logged in `docs/prompts.md`. This file (`jules.md`) tracks project notes and context.
- Next Steps (Post Model Implementation): The overall project plan involves developing abstractions, service implementations for API endpoints, HTTP client helpers, and a global exception handling system.
- (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC - Note: Dynamic timestamp failed): Completed the extensive model creation phase (Steps 3-22 of the plan of 2024-06-20). All listed P0, P1, P2, and relevant P3 models from `docs/plans/01-core-models-actual.md` have been implemented, including request/response DTOs and specific helper types for various API features like Attachments, Checklists, Comments, Custom Fields, Task Relationships, Folders, Guest Management, Lists, Member/Roles, Shared Hierarchy, Space Tags, Task Templates, Legacy Time Tracking, Time Entry Tags, User Management, Views, Workspace Plan/Seats, User Groups, and initial V3 API models (Audit Logs, Privacy/Access). The `User.cs` entity was also created/updated as part of this process.

## Current Task Context (from last user prompt):
The primary task of creating all planned C# models for the ClickUp API client library, as outlined in `docs/plans/01-core-models-actual.md` and guided by `docs/plans/01-core-models-conceptual.md`, is now complete. This involved implementing entities, request/response DTOs, and helper types, and organizing them into the `src/ClickUp.Api.Client.Models/` directory structure.

## Current Focus
Model creation phase is complete. Awaiting next steps which, according to the original high-level plan, would involve developing abstractions, service implementations, HTTP client helpers, etc.
